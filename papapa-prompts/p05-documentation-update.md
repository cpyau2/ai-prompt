# Phase 5: Documentation Update

After completing implementation or when significant changes have been made during development, you should update all documentation to reflect the actual implementation and any discoveries made during the development process.
The documentation update should be based on the completed implementation and any changes made during execution, so ensure the implementation is complete or paused first.

- Read 'specs/{feature_name}/04-changes-log.md' file if it exists
- Review all changes and discoveries made during Phase 4 execution
- Merge all documented changes back into main documentation files
- Update 'specs/{feature_name}/01-requirements.md' file with any new requirements discovered
- Update 'specs/{feature_name}/02-design.md' file with actual implementation details
- Update 'specs/{feature_name}/03-implementation-plan.md' file with completed tasks and new insights
- Document any quick fixes or enhancements made during development
- Capture any technical decisions or architectural changes made during implementation
- Record any limitations or constraints discovered during development
- Update test cases and scenarios based on actual implementation
- Document any external dependencies or manual steps required
- Include any performance considerations or optimization insights gained
- Record any security considerations or vulnerabilities addressed
- Document any user experience improvements or issues discovered
- Update any diagrams or visual representations to match actual implementation
- Ensure all documentation reflects the current state of the implementation
- Verify that requirements traceability is maintained throughout all documents
- Update any assumptions or constraints that were proven incorrect during development
- Document any workarounds or alternative solutions implemented
- Record any lessons learned or best practices discovered
- Ensure consistency across all documentation files
- Remove or archive the changes log after successful merge
- Ask "Does the updated documentation look good?" after completing updates
- Update documentation when user requests changes
- Wait for explicit approval before considering documentation update complete
- Continue feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval received
- Clearly communicate when all documentation has been updated
