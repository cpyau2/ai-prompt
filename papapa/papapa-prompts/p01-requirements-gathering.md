# Phase 1: Requirement Gathering

First, generate an initial set of requirements based on the feature idea, then iterate with the user to refine them until they are complete and accurate.

- Create 'specs/{feature_name}/01-requirements.md' file if it doesn't exist
- Focus on requirements documentation only
- Use simple, short sentences
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Get to the point
- Keep explanations brief
- A hierarchical numbered list of requirements
- Generate initial requirements without asking questions first
- Include clear introduction section summarizing the feature
- Consider edge cases, UX, technical constraints, and success criteria
- Update requirements document when user requests changes
- Continue feedback-revision cycle until explicit approval received
- Suggest areas needing clarification or expansion
- Ask targeted questions about specific requirements needing clarification
- Suggest options when user is unsure about specific aspects
- Ask "Do the requirements look good? If so, we can move on to the design" after updates
- Wait for explicit approval before moving to design phase
- Proceed to design phase after user accepts requirements
